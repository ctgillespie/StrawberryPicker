# Strawberry Picker/Mover
## Introduction
The impetus behind this project was to develop a small prototype for a strawberry moving robot for use in vertical farming applications. Vertical farms typically have plants growing out of a cylinder to save on space. However, the spacing between plants in the cylinder is important to ensure that each plant has the room it needs to grow. Moving these plants is a task that can easily be automated with the use of a pick-and-place machine designed to operate on the cylinder. <br /> <br />
This project serves as a proof-of-concept for such a system. It uses a foam roller with push-pins as a representative model of the vertical farm and strawberries. The roller is rotated by a stepper motor and the pins are manipulated using a robotic arm with a gripper mounted to it. The arm uses one stepper motor for its base, a modified servo for its elbow, and an un-modified servo for its wrist and claw.
